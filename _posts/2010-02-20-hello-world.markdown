Here is the obligitory hello world post for this new blog. I was more intersted in trying out a few github projects than starting a new blog, so don't be surprised if this is the only post you see here.

The following projects were used to create this blog:

1. [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) - a blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby
2. [Compass](http://github.com/chriseppstein/compass) - a Stylesheet Authoring Environment that makes your website design simpler to implement and easier to maintain.

Jekyll is a pretty cool blog engine that combines templates and post files to generate static files for the blog. It was a pretty easy install and after looking at a couple template examples of fellow Jekyll users, my (basic) templates were a snap to create. 

Compass is another cool project I have been wanting to use for some time. Compass is a CSS framework that takes [sass](http://sass-lang.com/) files and creates the CSS. Sass is a HAML based CSS language.
