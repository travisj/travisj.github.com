title: My favorite thing about Jekyll
layout: post
---

For a few months I have been searching for a vim plugin that would allow me to post to my Wordpress blog directly from vim. There is a ruby-based Textmate bundle that would allow for blogging from Textamte, but I couldn't find a suitable replacement for vim. The beauty of Jekyll is that since posting is handled by creating a text file, you are free to use any text editor you choose - in my case vim! I now need to find a good markdown vim plugin (hopefully for snipmate) to make blogging here even easier.

Ok, enough writing about Jekyll. My one day infatuation with it is over. Going forward I am going to use this site to write about purely technical topics and hopefully start writing and sharing code on github. If you want to know what I had for lunch [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/travisj) and if you want to know a minute by minute recount of what I did this weekend, read [my personal blog](http://travisj.org). Enjoy!
